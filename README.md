# Queens


Course: COMP 3201 Introduction to Nature-Inspired Computing  <br>
Topics: Evolutionary Algorithms <br>
Professor: Dr.Mark Hatcher http://www.cs.mun.ca/~mhatcher/  <br>





A special thanks to Dr.Hatcher for implementing a fun and great way to learn path searching methods. And also for giving me permission to share my experience with these assignments.
Unfortunaltely, to avoid future students using my code in the class I am unable to show the code. If you have any questions let me know at klan@mun.ca!
To play with the program, **the tester file can be modified** <br>



**How to run the program**

Open console (terminal, command.exe, etc)

Navigate to inside the Lights Out folder

Compile the code:

javac *.java

Run the code:

java Tester


The program should look like this:

This assignment allowed students to have a better understanding of how evoluntionary algorithms work by implementing the following functions:

9 10 6 5 3 2 11 1 4 7 8 12

means that a queen is located at (column 1, row 9) (Column 2, row 10) ....

By testing the fitness of the genotypes, the program can move closer to a solution to solve the N queens problem
