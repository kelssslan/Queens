Course: COMP 3200 Algorithmic Techniques for Artificial Intelligence  <br>
Topics: BFS, DFS, Greedy algorithm, heuristic functions <br>
Professor: Dr.Mark Hatcher http://www.cs.mun.ca/~mhatcher/   <br>


A special thanks to Dr.Churchill for implementing a fun and great way to learn path searching methods. And also for giving me permission to share my experience with these assignments.
Unfortunaltely, to avoid future students using my code in the class I am unable to show the code. If you have any questions let me know at klan@mun.ca!
To play with the program, the tester file can be modified
